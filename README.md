This example demonstrates a common Python error: a TypeError caused by passing incompatible data types to a function. The function `function` is designed to add two numbers.  However, it is called with an integer (5) and a string ("hello"), resulting in a TypeError because Python cannot directly add a number and a string. The solution showcases how to handle this error using type checking or error handling.
